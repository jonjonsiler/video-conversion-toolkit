Senate Republicans unveil,  half of their agenda for the upcoming legislative session.  The GOP members of the senate want to cap property taxes at 3% a year and are opposed to any new taxes.    The state Fire Marshal has begun a furlough plan to deal with ongoing budget cuts.  The days off work without pay will impact only the administrative staff.   The state schools for the blind and deaf are being impacted by state budget cuts more than other departments in the state Department of Rehabilitation Services.  The schools operate just off of state funds and donations.  Agency officials say they are doing all they can to keep both schools accredited and intact.   For the first time since the 2003 budget crisis, the average amount of money spent for each student in Oklahoma public schools is going down. The mid-year allocations were sent out to the school districts this week.   The Hitachi Computer Products plant in Norman is doubling in size with the addition of a new distribution center.  That will mean about 75 new jobs.</p>]]></annotation>

The Mayor says their center feed 65 people every day which is a large site and it was closed because of the perception that Edmond is a wealthy city that can afford to cover the cost of the feeding program. 

A new poll of Oklahomans shows 83% support development of wind power and are willing to pay more for it.  They also favor mandates that require more wind power production.  The poll was done as a way to influence policy on wind energy in the months ahead. 

Relatives of Jim Thorpe are going to court to try and have his body reburied in Oklahoma.  His remains are currently interred in Jim Thorpe Pennsylvania in a deal that was put together by his widow. 

The Oklahoma City Animal Shelter has set a record for, Adoptions.  Last month 777 animals were adopted out to new homes.  The shelter has a special offer right now for anyone looking to adopt a pet. 

We talk In-Depth with the Chairman of the Political Science Department at OCU about the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall and what if any lasting impact that event has on the world.

Budget cuts are coming to an Oklahoma institution of higher learning.  USAO in Chickasha is cutting salaries, furloughing workers during the holidays and ending annuity payments to try and balance their budget. 

The I.R.S. is looking for more than 11-hundred Oklahomans who are due refunds but the checks were returned as undeliverable.  The checks total more than a million dollars. 

 As an Enid couple was driving home from church along a rural road outside of town, they encountered a site that truly caught them off guard.  Standing in the roadway was an elephant.

			<annotation><![CDATA[The Oklahoma Department of Human Services has decided to cut nearly 30% of the state&#039;s nutrition program budget prompting a state lawmaker to call for a special legislative session.  Senator Kenneth Corn says the move will close senior nutrition centers statewide and imperil the lives of thousands of senior citizens. 

A group of state legislators is considering making Oklahoma&#039;s criminal code more user friendly. State Rep. Mark McCullough, (R) Sapulpa, says criminal law needs to be streamlined and centralized to make it easier for attorneys, judges, police and the public to understand. Critics say gutting existing statutes could have the unintended effect of loss of case law. 

President Obama has nominated Sandford Coats to be the new U.S. attorney for the Western District of Oklahoma. Coats has been assistant U.S. attorney since 2004. 

Congress&#039; failure to pass agency budget bills could cause problems for road and bridge projects in Oklahoma. The state is expecting $40 million in reimbursement, but there is no money in the Federal Highway Trust Fund to pay the state back. 

The first swine flu vaccine could arrive in Oklahoma early next week, but supply will be very limited. Only about 21,000 doses of flu mist inhaled inoculations are being made available for use by healthy people. The State Health Department is working on a plan to determine who will get them. 
New efforts are underway to ban text messaging while driving in Oklahoma. Currently 20 states and the District of Columbia prohibit the practice.
