Senate Republicans unveil,  half of their agenda for the upcoming legislative session.  The GOP members of the senate want to cap property taxes at 3% a year and are opposed to any new taxes.    The state Fire Marshal has begun a furlough plan to deal with ongoing budget cuts.  The days off work without pay will impact only the administrative staff.   The state schools for the blind and deaf are being impacted by state budget cuts more than other departments in the state Department of Rehabilitation Services.  The schools operate just off of state funds and donations.  Agency officials say they are doing all they can to keep both schools accredited and intact.   For the first time since the 2003 budget crisis, the average amount of money spent for each student in Oklahoma public schools is going down. The mid-year allocations were sent out to the school districts this week.   The Hitachi Computer Products plant in Norman is doubling in size with the addition of a new distribution center.

Teen Em Power is getting the credit for cutting the number of pregnant children at Taft Middle School to zero from six the semester before.  The program is funded through donations. 

An Oklahoman is among three Ft. Carson soldiers who were killed in Afghanistan in an attack by insurgents.  19-year old Private John P. Dion of Shattuck died Sunday from wounds he suffered when his unit was hit by small arms fire and improvised explosives. 

About two dozen schools in northeastern Oklahoma are still closed because of icy roads left over from recent winter storms.  While primary roads in the area have been cleared rural roads have not. 

House Speaker Chris Benge has cancelled any pre-session meetings of legislative committees to try and save money.  Lawmakers go back to work February 2nd and in past years committees meet to get ready for the session.  No pre-session meetings may save up to $20,000. 

The I.R.S. has decided to begin regulating tax preparers, to end abuses and errors in tax returns.  We talk with a CPA about what the new rules will mean for consumers.

The Mayor says their center feed 65 people every day which is a large site and it was closed because of the perception that Edmond is a wealthy city that can afford to cover the cost of the feeding program. 

A new poll of Oklahomans shows 83% support development of wind power and are willing to pay more for it.  They also favor mandates that require more wind power production.  The poll was done as a way to influence policy on wind energy in the months ahead. 

Relatives of Jim Thorpe are going to court to try and have his body reburied in Oklahoma.  His remains are currently interred in Jim Thorpe Pennsylvania in a deal that was put together by his widow. 

The Oklahoma City Animal Shelter has set a record for, Adoptions.  Last month 777 animals were adopted out to new homes.  The shelter has a special offer right now for anyone looking to adopt a pet. 

We talk In-Depth with the Chairman of the Political Science Department at OCU about the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall and what if any lasting impact that event has on the world.
